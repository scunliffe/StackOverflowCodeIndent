StackOverflowCodeIndent
=======================

Indents your highlighted code on StackOverflow.com and similar StackExchange sites.

After reading a question on meta.stackoverflow.com (http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/266253/indentation-feature) I felt the pain of Oliver (http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/1022330/oliver-watkins) as I too have wished for such a feature!

I've used StackOverflow since it was in beta and often find that I'm copying/pasting code into the textarea provided after whipping it up in my editor.

When added to the textarea it is always "flush" with the left margin.
